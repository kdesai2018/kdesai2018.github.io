Infolynx was a hackathon project built with Ansh Jain, Didi Zhou and Emily Peterson. InfoLynx is an intelligent information overlay for YouTube. We used the YouTube API, React, Python, IBM Natural Language Understanding API and Google Knowledge graph to display contextual information to the student while watching a video.
