BEVO (Blind Environment Visualization Objects) was a hackathon project built with Akarsh Kumar, Amitesh Yeleswarapu and Jack Wang. It uses Tensorflow, Google Cloud, Python and OpenCV to help visually impaired users navigate in unknown environments.

This project won the JP Morgan challenge and the "Best Use of Google Cloud" challenge at TAMUHack. Check out the Devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/bevo-blindenvironmentvisualizationoperations) and the codebase [here](https://github.com/kdesai2018/bevo).
