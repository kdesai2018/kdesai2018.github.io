title: SummerHacks 2020
---
I'm part of [Freetail Hackers](https://freetailhackers.com/) at the University of Texas at Austin. As a student-run organization, we aim to host and organize hackathons at UT, and compete in hackathons around the country.

Looking around, we saw a large number of our peers having their internships cancelled due to COVID-19. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we are organizing SummerHacks, a 12-week virtual hackathon. Our goal is to match up teams of students with experience mentors and help every attendee create a project they can be proud of by the end of the summer. You can learn more about this project [here](https://freetailhackers.com/summerhacks).

In addition, we are developing the [ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide). We want this to be a central reference for all hackathon attendees, whether they be experienced hackers looking to brush up on specific topics or first-time attendees who are trying to understand what is going on. Give it a look and feel free to fork the repo to make any suggestions!
