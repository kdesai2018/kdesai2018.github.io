## What have I been up to

Apologies to my 0 weekly readers for my absence - I've been swamped with research and school over the past couple weeks. Anyways, here is a brief list of some interesting and thought-provoking videos/books I have watched/read recently.

### Videos

* [When Time Became History - Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWu29PRCUvQ) - Super short video on the history of our evolution as a species.
* [Decision Trees - ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kakLu2is3ds) - To be fair, this was intended to supplement a topic I have been learning about in class. However, I thought ritvik (I assume) did a great job explaining a pretty complex topic with a relatively simple example.
* [Winning Google Kickstart A - William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGrBHohIgQY) - I just want to code as well as this guy someday.
* "The Social Dilemma" on Netflix - This is one of those documentaries that really makes you question your daily routine and schedule. Worth a watch for anyone semi-addicted to their phones who wants to be scared out of their rut.

### Books

* [Zero To One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) by Peter Thiel - This might be the best book about the future of entrepreneurship and technology I have ever read. It's pretty short (300-ish pages) and definitely changed my perspective on how the future will unfold. 
* [Cloud Atlas](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Atlas-Novel-David-Mitchell/dp/0375507256) by David Mitchell - I just started this book, but I'm already hooked. Be warned - this is a heavy read (I've been trying to read a couple pages a day).
* [Bad Blood](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X) by John Carreyrou - Great read about the inner workings of Silicon Valley, and about what can go wrong when basic human incentives get muddled up by greed.
