Hi! My name is Kush Desai and I am a computer engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I've been reading several blogs by researchers I look up to recently, and I created this blog in an attempt to emulate them (Example [1](https://jxyzabc.blogspot.com), [2](http://karpathy.github.io) and [3](https://scottaaronson.blog)). This will also force me to write out my thoughts clearly, share my work and best of all, remind me what I have done!
