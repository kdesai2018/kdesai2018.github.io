Hi! My name is Kush Desai and I am a computer engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm creating this blog with the goal of maintaining a running log of the work that I do. 

I also work as a research assistant at the [Socially Intelligent Machines Lab](http://sim.ece.utexas.edu/) under Dr. Andrea Thomaz, where I am working on improving human-robot interaction technology. 

Some of my current academic interests include computer vision, digital animation and image processing.
