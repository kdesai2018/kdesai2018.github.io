title: 2021 so far
---

## What I've been doing
I interned at [Diligent Robotics](http://diligentrobots.com) as a SWE intern during my Spring semester. I'm currently a Production Engineering intern at [Facebook](facebook.com) before I head back to UT to finish up my senior year.

## What I've been reading
I've gotten into reading more theoretical science/logic books. Two of my favorite so far are 
- [Godel, Escher, Bach - An Eternal Golden Braid](https://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_2?crid=350S9J2FZH0O4&dchild=1&keywords=godel+escher+bach+by+douglas+hofstadter&qid=1628627667&s=books&sprefix=godel+es%2Cstripbooks%2C155&sr=1-2)
- [When Einstein walked with Godel: Excursions to the Edge of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_2?crid=350S9J2FZH0O4&dchild=1&keywords=godel+escher+bach+by+douglas+hofstadter&qid=1628627667&s=books&sprefix=godel+es%2Cstripbooks%2C155&sr=1-2)

## Goals
I'm currently working on my graduate schools applications (for a PhD). Another stretch goal I have for the semester is to be better about tracking stuff. By this, I mean tracking everything from applications to my workouts. I'm thinking of using [Notion](notion.so) for this, let's see how it works out.
