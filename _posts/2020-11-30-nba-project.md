Hey all,

It's been a busy few months with school, but I wanted to take a few minutes to share a class project I've been working on. This was with [Akarsh Kumar](http://www.akarshkumar.com). Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/TboPF-H-13Q) and let me know what you think.

<!-- Other than that, check out [A Promised Land](https://bookstorelink.com/9781524763169). I'm a chapter in and already hooked by Obama's writing style. -->
