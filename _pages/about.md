Hi! I'm Kush. I graduated from the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu) in May 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering specializing in Data Science and Information Processing. Over my time at UT, I worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Socially Intelligent Machines Lab](https://sim.ece.utexas.edu/people.html) with [Professor Andrea Thomaz](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/andrea-thomaz), was a part of the [Punjabbawockeez](https://www.instagram.com/punjabbawockeez/) and helped organize HackTX with [Freetail Hackers](http://freetailhackers.com). I was also a a co-host of the [Talking Robotics](http://talking-robotics.github.io) seminar series.

I'm currently a [Production Engineer](https://tech.facebook.com/ideas/2022/10/how-meta-production-engineers-solve-the-problem-of-scale/) at Meta learning how to build secure, reliable infrastructure for [Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/).
