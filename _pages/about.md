Hi! I'm Kush, a senior at the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu). I'll be graduating in May 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering, specializing in Data Science and Information Processing. I've worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Socially Intelligent Machines Lab](https://sim.ece.utexas.edu/people.html) with [Professor Andrea Thomaz](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/andrea-thomaz). 

I'm currently applying to PhD programs with the goal of furthering human robot collaboration. I've developed this interest through my research collaboration with [Akanksha Saran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akanksha-saran) as well as my internship experience at [Diligent Robotics](http://diligentrobots.com). I am also a co-host of the [Talking Robotics](http://talking-robotics.github.io) seminar series.

Outside of work and school, I enjoy reading science fiction, nerding out about the [MCU](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) and playing amateur-level chess.
