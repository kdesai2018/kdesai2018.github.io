Hi! I'm Kush. I graduated from the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu) May 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering, specializing in Data Science and Information Processing. Over my time at UT, I've worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [Socially Intelligent Machines Lab](https://sim.ece.utexas.edu/people.html) with [Professor Andrea Thomaz](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/andrea-thomaz), was a part of the [Punjabbawockeez](https://www.instagram.com/punjabbawockeez/) and helped organize HackTX with [Freetail Hackers](http://freetailhackers.com)

I'm starting my new role as a Production Engineer at Meta in July 2022 in Menlo Park. I also volunteer as a co-host of the [Talking Robotics](http://talking-robotics.github.io) seminar series.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading everything ranging science fiction to political theory. I'm currently working my way through the [Hyperion Cantos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) by Dan Simmons. I am also reading **The Emperor's New Mind** by Roger Penrose.
